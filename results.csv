Objective:
We examined the relationship of presence and search for meaning in life with age, physical and mental well-being, and cognitive functioning across the adult lifespan.

Methods:
Cross-sectional data from 1,042 adults in the Successful AGing Evaluation (SAGE) – a multicohort study of adult community-dwelling residents of San Diego County, CA – were analyzed. Presence of meaning and Search for meaning in life were assessed with Meaning in Life Questionnaire. Physical and mental well-being were measured using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status - modified (TICS-m) was employed to screen for overall cognitive function. Study data were collected from January 2013 to June 2014.

Results:
Presence of meaning exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship whereas Search showed a U-shaped relationship with age (Presence peaking and Search reaching the lowest point around age 60). Statistical modelling using Generalized Estimating Equations revealed that Physical well-being (SF-36 physical composite score) correlated negatively with age (p <.001), and positively with Presence (p <.001), and there was an age group × Presence interaction (p = 0.018), such that the relationship was stronger in subjects over age 60. Mental well-being positively correlated with age (p = <.001) and Presence (p <.001), and negatively with Search (p = .002). Cognitive function correlated inversely with age (p <.001) and with Search (p <.001). Significant covariates of Presence and Search had small effect sizes, except for medium effect size for satisfaction with life and Presence in adults over age 60 (p <.001).

Conclusions:
Presence and search for meaning in life are important for health and well-being, though the relationships differ in adults younger and older than 60 years. Better understanding of the longitudinal relationships of meaning of life with well-being are warranted to design interventions to increase meaning of life and improve health and functioning.

"Abstract  
A model of the processes leading to posttraumatic growth and to life satisfaction following exposure to trauma was tested. Two types of repeated thought, deliberate and intrusive, posttraumatic symptoms, posttraumatic growth, and meaning in life, were assessed as predictors of general life satisfaction. Challenges to core beliefs were shown to be related to both intrusive and deliberate rumination. The two forms of rumination were in turn differentially related to posttraumatic growth and posttraumatic distress. Distress and posttraumatic growth were independently and oppositely related to meaning in life and to life satisfaction. Overall, the best fitting model was supportive of proposed posttraumatic growth models. Additional exploratory analyses examined participant groupings, based of self-reported category of resolution of the traumatic experience, and differences supportive of proposed underlying processes were found.

"Abstract  
The objective of the present research is to explore the predictive association of meaning in life (presence & search) with psychological distress (depression, anxiety & stress) in people with substance use disorder. Sample of the present study comprised 200 Muslim participants (male patients with substance use disorder), ages ranging from 18 to 45 years (M =18; SD =6.55). The sample was recruited from different substance use treatment and rehabilitation centers situated in different areas of Karachi, through purposive sampling. Instruments used in this study were the Personal Information Form, Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ; Stegaer, et al., 2006), and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS; Lovibond, & Lovibond, 1995). Regression analysis shows a significant predictive relationship of meaning in life (i.e., presence & search of the meaning) with depression (adj R2=.988, F (2, 198) =8278.46, P < .0001(, anxiety (adj R2=.943, F (2, 198) =1659.82, P < .0001(, stress (adj R2=.982, F (2, 198) =5390.78, P < .0001(. Overall findings revealed that meaning in life is a significant predictor of psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety & stress) in people with SUD. The finding and implications are discussed in detail.",Yes,https://jpps.pk/index.php/journal/article/view/207
"Abstract  
Viktor Frankl theorized that an absence of meaning in one’s life can result in boredom and apathy—the “existential vacuum”—and attempts to avoid or “escape” the vacuum can include short-acting distracting behaviors. This study investigated whether the presence of meaning (PM) or the search for meaning are associated with alcohol, drug, and cigarette use by young adults, and whether boredom mediates those relationships. Hundred and seventy-six young adults completed the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and provided information about cigarette and illicit drug use over the preceding year. The results partly support Frankl’s model: higher PM was associated with lower alcohol/other drug use and boredom mediated those relationships, but PM was not related to cigarette smoking. Contrary to Frankl’s model, no relationship was found between search for meaning and alcohol, drug, or cigarette use. This suggests that psychological interventions that assist individuals who use drugs or alcohol to identify meaning or purpose in their lives might reduce levels of drug and alcohol use. The process of searching for meaning may not have substantial direct impact on levels of substance use, but once some meaning was established there may be decreased impetus to continue using drugs and alcohol.",Yes,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022167816687674

"The objective of this study was to explore the roles of meaning in life (presence and search), optimism, hope (pathway and agency), additional contribution of coping styles (cognitive-affective coping and instrumental-emotional support) in prediction of life satisfaction and positive affectivity components of subjective well-being. A pilot study was conducted with 519 (327 female, 192 male) students at various faculties at Afyon Kocatepe University for Turkish adaptation of Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ). The findings of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that 10-item scale with two factors- presence of meaning and search for meaning. Validity and reliability analyses displayed that MLQ has good psychometric properties. For the main purpose of the study, MLQ, Life Orientation Test (LOT), Hope Scale, and Brief COPE, Positive-Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were adminstered to 1160 students but analyses were completed with 984 (582 female and 402 male) students from Afyon Kocatepe University. Two hierarchical multiple regression analyses were run separately for positive affectivity, and life satisfaction. First analysis revealed that optimism, pathway and agency dimensions of hope significantly and positively predicted positive affectivity when instrumental-emotional support added into the model, this variable resulted in significant increase of .05% explained variance. The second analysis indicated that presence and search dimensions of meaning in life, optimism, and agency dimension of hope scale significantly predicted life satisfaction and when instrumental-emotional support added into the model, this variable resulted in significant increase in .01% explained variance. Results were discussed in relation to the findings in the literature.",Yes,https://open.metu.edu.tr/handle/11511/22126
